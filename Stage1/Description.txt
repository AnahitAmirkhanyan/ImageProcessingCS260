None of the images that were assigned to me exhibited the Standard Behavior.

For this reason, to work with various filters I have chosen the first picture in the FEI database.

RESULTS:

Both Minimum and Maximum filters ended up providing undesired effects.
The most effective filter for trying to remove insignificant details and smoothen prominent regions is Gaussian Blur. 
Gaussian Blur can be used on its own as well as in a combination with Median and Mean filters.
